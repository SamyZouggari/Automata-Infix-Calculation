# AutomataInfixCalculation
In this project, I developed Python scripts that implement automata to recognize and validate various numeric values, such as integers and decimals. I then created an infix calculator for mathematical expressions. Finally, I built a script to separate lexemes and tokens, showcasing my problem-solving skills in data processing.
